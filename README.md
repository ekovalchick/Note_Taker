  ## Description
  
 This porject uses express to create api and html route to access this note taking web-app. This app is also linked through github and heroku. This app uses CRUD properties to create, read, update and delete tasks the user inserts on the webpage. the biggest lesson I learned from this is how to implement heroku and the CRUD system. I created this app to test my knowledge on back-end development using express and to create an easy to use note taker.
